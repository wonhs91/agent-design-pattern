      "- **Type Checking**: The function does not check if the input `n` is an integer. It should raise a `TypeError` if the input is not an integer, as factorials are only defined for integers.\n",
      "- **Performance**: While the loop implementation is correct, for large values of `n`, using Python's built-in `math.factorial` function would be more efficient and concise.\n",
      "- **Docstring Improvement**: The docstring could mention that the function expects an integer input explicitly, not just a non-negative integer.\n",
      "- **Code Style**: The code is generally well-written, but it could benefit from using a more Pythonic approach, such as using `math.factorial` for clarity and efficiency.\n",
